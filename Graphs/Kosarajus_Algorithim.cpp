      <--Kosarajus Algorithm For Strongly Connected Components-->
      

     -> Kosarajus Algorithim is used to print strongly Connected components in the order
     ->It uses Topological sorting to get the first to visit edges

     Steps in Kosaraju Algorithim->

      1)->Do a Topological Sort order of the Graph
      2)->Use stack to store the Topological Order
      3)->Reverse The edges to make sure strongly connected compenents be in order
      4)->Do a DFS Traversal based on stack(Topological order) Elements
      5)->We get a Strongly Connected Componets of the graph

      Time Complixity :->O(V+E);
      Space Complixity:->O(V+E);

Here are the key points about Kosaraju's Algorithm:

1. **Two-Pass DFS**:
    - Involves two main passes of Depth-First Search (DFS).

2. **First Pass**:
    - Perform DFS on the original graph.
    - Push vertices onto a stack in the order of their finish times.

3. **Graph Reversal**:
    - Reverse all the edges in the graph to form the transposed graph.

4. **Second Pass**:
    - Perform DFS on the transposed graph.
    - Process vertices in the order determined by the stack from the first pass.
    - Each DFS traversal in this step identifies a strongly connected component (SCC).

5. **Stack Usage**:
    - A stack is used to store vertices in the order of their finish times during the first pass of DFS.

6. **Time Complexity**:
    - Runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

7. **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is O(V + E) due to storing the graph and its transpose.

8. **Output**:
    - Identifies all strongly connected components (SCCs) in the graph.

9. **Efficiency**:
    - Efficient for large graphs due to its linear time complexity.
